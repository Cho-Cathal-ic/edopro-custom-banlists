# edopro-custom-banlists

# How to install a banlist:
Just drop the corresponding .lflist.conf file into ProjectIgnis/repositories/lflists, close any instances of EDOPRO and open a new one. 

# For Edison:
[Edison.lflist.conf](https://github.com/diamonddudetcg/edopro-custom-banlists/releases/tag/Edison)


# For Tengu Plant:
[Tengu Plant.lflist.conf](https://github.com/diamonddudetcg/edopro-custom-banlists/releases/tag/TenguPlant)


# For Common Charity
[Common.Charity.lflist.conf](https://github.com/diamonddudetcg/edopro-custom-banlists/releases/tag/CommonCharity)

Common Charity is a different beast than retro formats in that the banlist can change and the cardpool will change with each set release. For that reason, [I wrote a shitty script](https://github.com/diamonddudetcg/edopro-custom-banlists/blob/main/generate-cc-banlist.py) anyone can run that outputs the most current banlist provided YGOPRODECK's API is behaving properly.
